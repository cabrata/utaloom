# Utaloom

YouTube Music client for **Linux and Windows**.
Built with Kotlin and Compose Multiplatform (Material 3), with libVLC on desktop.

Both platforms compile the same Utaloom UI, library, extraction, lyrics and Listen Together sources.

## Install

### Requirements

Desktop uses **libVLC**, supplied by the installer/package manager:

| Package | VLC |
|---------|-----|
| Windows `.msi` | Bundled inside the installer |
| `.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu) | Pulled in automatically by `sudo apt install ./utaloom_*.deb` |
| `.rpm` (Fedora) | Pulled in automatically by `sudo dnf install ./utaloom-*.rpm` (needs [RPM Fusion](https://rpmfusion.org/Configuration) for some codecs) |
| Other / run from source | Install VLC (`sudo pacman -S vlc`, etc.) |

If VLC is installed somewhere unusual, set `VLC_PATH` to the folder that contains `libvlc`.

### Download

Grab the latest build from [Releases](../../releases) or the [Actions](../../actions) artifacts:

- **Windows**: `utaloom-x.y.z.msi`
- **Debian/Ubuntu**: `utaloom_x.y.z_amd64.deb` (`sudo apt install ./utaloom_*.deb`)
- **Other Linux**: the portable app folder, run `bin/utaloom`

Desktop packages bundle their own Java runtime.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Keys | Action |
|------|--------|
| Ctrl + Space | Play / pause |
| Ctrl + → / ← | Next / previous |
| Ctrl + ↑ / ↓ | Volume up / down |
| Ctrl + L | Like current song |
| F11 | Toggle full-screen player (with a current song) |
| Esc | Exit full screen |
| Alt + ← | Back |
| Media keys | Play/pause, next, previous |

## Listen Together

Open **Together**, enter a username, then **Create room** and share the code, or **Join room** with a friend's code.
Everyone in a room must use the same server.

The default server is `wss://utaloom.caliph.dev/ws`. You can change it in **Settings**.

## Signing in

Utaloom has no embedded browser, so sign-in uses your YouTube Music cookie:

1. Open https://music.youtube.com in your browser and sign in.
2. Open DevTools (F12) → Network, reload, click any request to `music.youtube.com`.
3. Copy the full `Cookie` request header.
4. Paste it in **Settings → Account**.

The cookie is stored only on your device and is **not encrypted**. On Linux the settings file is owner-only. On Windows it inherits your user-profile folder permissions. Treat it like a password and never share `settings.json`.

## Data location

| OS | Folder |
|----|--------|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\utaloom` |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/utaloom` |

## Build from source

Requires JDK 21 and VLC 64-bit. Run the Windows installer tasks on Windows, with WiX Toolset 3 installed.

```bash
./gradlew :app:run                 # run
./gradlew :shared:jvmTest :app:test # parser, validation and codec tests
./gradlew :app:playerSmoke         # real native VLC paused-load/play/seek/pause check
./gradlew :app:networkSmoke        # live YouTube playback, download and offline playback check
./gradlew :app:lyricsProbe         # asks every lyrics provider for one song (live network)
./gradlew :app:ltProbe             # live host/guest check against configured test server
./gradlew :app:togetherAcceptance  # live desktop app ListenTogether + Player acceptance check
./gradlew :app:packageDeb          # Linux .deb
./gradlew :app:packageMsi          # Windows .msi (run on Windows)
./gradlew :app:createDistributable # portable app folder
```

On a drive without executable permissions, use `bash ./gradlew ...`. On Windows use `gradlew.bat ...` in PowerShell or Command Prompt.
For remote/headless Linux testing, run with `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Dskiko.renderApi=SOFTWARE` under Xvfb.
GitHub Releases build and publish the desktop installers from `appVersion`.

Project layout:

- `shared/` Kotlin Multiplatform logic (lyrics parsing, input validation)
- `innertube/` YouTube Music parsing/API module, with a JVM build and desktop logging shim
- `app/` shared Compose UI, queue/player logic, Listen Together, downloads and desktop host/adapters

## Limitations

Not available on desktop yet: Google sign-in through a web page, account sync of likes/playlists back to YouTube, equalizer, crossfade, song recognition, widgets, Discord rich presence, Chromecast.

Some tracks may be unavailable because of YouTube client restrictions, regional rules or authentication requirements. Stream extraction uses direct URLs supported by VLC. It intentionally does not advertise SABR or bounded-range playback support. Downloads can use bounded ranges. The interface is currently English. Windows installers are unsigned, so SmartScreen may display a warning.

## Verification

Linux and Windows CI both run parser/input/codec tests plus native VLC paused buffering, play, seek and pause checks, then build their installers. Linux live checks also covered YouTube playback, downloading and offline playback. A separate two-client live check verifies room creation, join approval and playback messages on the default Listen Together server. Account login needs your own cookie and is not automatically exercised by CI.
